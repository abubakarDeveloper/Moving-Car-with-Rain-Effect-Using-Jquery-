# Moving-Car-with-Rain-Effect-Using-Jquery--CSS
# In this repository i have created a animation using html, css, javascript, Jquery in which a car will be moving in a rain.
I have created dynamic rain drops using Jquery and motion in car is due to css.   You can control car motion by pressing D or Enter from Keyboard and also turn headlights ON or OFF by pressing W from keyboard. just download files then launch car.html file and you will see a beautifull animation. 
# Following are the keys used for Car control:
