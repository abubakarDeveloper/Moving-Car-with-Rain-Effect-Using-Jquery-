# Moving-Car-with-Rain-Effect-Using-Jquery--CSS
# In this repository i have created a animation using html, css, javascript, Jquery in which a car will be moving in a rain.
 I have created dynamic rain drops using Jquery and motion in car is due to css.   You can control car motion by pressing D or Enter from Keyboard and also turn headlights ON or OFF by pressing W from keyboard.
# Following are the keys used for Car control:
   W: To turn lights On or OFF
   D: To stop or move car.
   Enter: Same as D.
